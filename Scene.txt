lav et script der kan styre alt lys i scenen (tænd sluk intensitet, lyst mørkt)
lige nu får vi dataen i {xxx,xxx} - prøv at visualiser det på en måde
prøv at få pupil dialation data
fiks spejlet på toilettet (det er for lyst)
find et vindue eller noget der ligner
tilføj evt. nogen af de "Ideas" som er længere nede.





Script:

You start in bright enviroment (maybe in toilet looking in mirror)
You walk around for an amount of time or when you reach a point.
Then the light dim down.
Some might blink, and some might not even be on.
You hear a metal door sound, maybe a howl from something not human.
Then all lights go out, and you only have normal night light.
Then you can walk around the house and interact with chairs, lights, w.e



Eye coords and pupil dialation data:

Get data for 1-5 minutes walking in daylight.
Get data for when the light changes.
Get data for 1-5 minutes walking in nighttime.
Get data for specific events, such as interactions with piano, chairs, sounds, w.e



Ideas:

When lights are turned off in BigRoom you can see the clock (maybe use that for something?)
Mirror interaction when you turn around.
Piano interaction. Play a scary tune?
TV interaction. Some schratchy flimmer.
When you step on stair, the steps makes noises. The higher you get the higher the sound, and more howling gets closer.
Sofa glass table can break
cup on a table interaction
towels interaction
door
paintings
